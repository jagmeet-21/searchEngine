It is written in the genre of paranormal romance urban fantasy and became popular with the young adult readers. We used to think that we see and are able to explain everything going on around us. So did sixteen-year-old Clary Fray. That’s why, having become the witness of a strange murder done by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos she couldn’t call the police as the last were invisible to everyone else and there was nothing – not even a smear of blood – to show that an innocent boy had been killed. She was not even sure if he was a boy. Equally startled by her ability to see them, the murderers explain themselves as Shadowhunters: a secret tribe of warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. The next day Clary’s mother decided to move but within twenty-four hours Clary’s mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque demon. The Shadowhunters are surprised that demons are interested in ordinary people like Clary and her mother. Or they are just supposed to be ordinary people … The Shadowhunters would like to know it. Clary gets into the world invisible to the ordinary people and has to fight with Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries. To save her mother from a magically induced coma, she is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil – and also her father. These are not all the secrets of her family. Love. Blood. Betrayal. Revenge. Darkness. Is a teenage girl able to survive and to save her mother despite all her cruel relatives and other evil creatures from the world of Shadowhunters? Non-stop action novel that blends magic with humor, romance with vengeance, resulting in an irresistible labyrinthine tale of rich and (seemingly) infinite subplots. This book has terror, unexpected twists, sorrow—it is tragedy edged by lightning, driven by power and love. This is a fast-paced dramatic fantasy with gorgeous language and memorable characters that you grow to love and worry about, as well as really funny bits that will make you honestly laugh and remember them and repeat them to your friends.
