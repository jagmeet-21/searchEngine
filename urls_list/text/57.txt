If so, you are lucky to have such a like-minded person as a vivid author Kathy Reichs who shares your ideas. She created 18 book series under the name “Temperance Brennan” devoted to carelessness of police. The main character, Dr. Temperance "Tempe" Brennan, is one of only fifty board-certified forensic anthropologists in North America, who investigates human remains at crime scenes where the flesh is too degraded for a coroner to obtain evidence. Tempe is first introduced in Déjà Dead. But the reader doesn’t learn everything about Brennan at the very first book, the author made it so that the every book of series step by step unfolds the reader learns more about her past and her family connections. The series is determined as fiction, but it also bears some characteristic features of horror, mystery and thriller. Thus, the reader will never become tired or bored. It should also be mentioned that all the novels are written in the first person, from Brennan's viewpoint. The interesting fact is that Brennan was almost copied from her creator, a forensic anthropologist. In a number of novels it is indicated that Brennan's background lies in physical anthropology, rather than medicine, and throughout the novels she stresses the importance of correct crime scene processes. This feature makes the books so outstanding making them different from usual detective detectives full of long boring descriptions of the process of solving of cases. It is difficult to stop once stepping into the world of Dr. Temperance Brennan, whose life is devoted to justice. Her aim is to stand up for the rights of those she never even knew and to fight against those who managed to whop the police shuts its eyes.
