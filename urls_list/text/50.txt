Pushing The Limits: Book 1 No one knows what happened the night Echo Emerson went from popular girl to the outsider, even Echo can't remember the whole truth. But when Noah Hutchins, the smoking-hot loner explodes into her life, Echo's world shifts in ways she could never have imagined. They should have nothing in common. Yet the crazy attraction between them refuses to go away. And Echo has to ask herself just how far they can push the limits. Dare You To: Book 2 If anyone knew the truth, they'd send Beth's mother to jail. So she protects her mum at all costs—until her uncle swoops in, and 17 year old Beth finds herself starting over at a school where no one understands her. Except one guy. Ryan Stone is a popular jock—with secrets he can't tell anyone. Not even the friends he shares everything with, including their crazy dares. The craziest? Asking out the skater girl. But what begins as a dare becomes an intense attraction. Suddenly, the boy with the flawless image is risking everything, and the girl who won't let anyone get too close is daring it all.... Crash Into You: Book 3 Rachel Young keeps secrets from her wealthy family...and she just added two to the list. One involves street racing in her Mustang GT. The other? Isaiah Walker—a guy she has no business even talking to. But after the foster kid with the tattoos comes to her rescue, she can't get him out of her mind. The last thing Isaiah needs is to get tangled up with a rich girl. But when their love of street racing puts their lives in jeopardy, Isaiah and Rachel will have just six weeks to come up with a way out. Take Me On: Book 4 Kickboxer Haley swore she'd never set foot in the ring again. But then West Young accepts a MMA fight in her honour and suddenly Haley has to train him. West is everything Haley promised herself she'd stay away from. Yet he won't last five seconds in the ring without her help. West is keeping a secret from Haley. About who he really is. But helping her—fighting for her—is a shot at redemption. He can't change the past, but maybe he can change Haley's future. Haley and West have agreed to keep their relationship strictly in the ring. But an unexpected attraction mocks their best intentions... Breaking The Rules: Book 5 For new high school graduate Echo Emerson, a summer road trip with her boyfriend means getting away from it all. And most of all, it means almost three months alone with Noah Hutchins. Echo and Noah share everything—except the one thing Echo's just not ready for.
