This book introduces homicide detective Jane Rizzoli. The following books of the series introduce us a medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles who collaborates with the central character. Two women are so different. The one is small, plain, obstinate but definitely resolute and fearless Jane Rizzoli. She is the only female-detective of homicide department of police office in Boston. Her male colleagues pay close attention to her personality. Thus, she has always to prove that she is not a black sheep and she is in her very place and is able to handle with her job as good as they do, sometimes even better. It is so indeed as very often Jane excels the stronger sex in murder investigations. The second one is doctor Maura Isles, a forensic pathologist, often called as a Queen of corpses. A green-eyed beautiful brunette with marbled skin, Cleopatra-style haircut. So cold, shallow she even seems to be out-of-body. Always faultlessly tailored with red-colored lips, she always makes everybody thrill. Not friendship but a kind of mutual understanding, which sometimes even doesn’t demand any words, connects Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles. They feel and understand each other so good and they hold each other in the greatest respect. Both of them are high-rated professionals. The first struggle with evil, the second treats dead people with respect and helps to find their murderers. And both are too feminine inside: vulnerable, defenseless, dreaming of love, family and a man who will protect them. === Mike:There is considerable differences between the books and show. The show is "HOLLYWOOD -TV" through and through. It is made to fulfill a man's fantasy of what a woman should be. The book Rozzoli is clearly plain looking, short and dressed as a professional cop. She is a human who happens to be female. While I like the actress playing her and who gets much of her character right, she is far too often put into the position of being a whiny, weak female rather than the total bad ass that she is. I stopped watching the show when they made her family the center of the show. Her mother should be shipped a thousand miles away. Isles also a very professional human who happens to be female has been turned into a caricature with no depth and so childish I cringe when I watch her. Put any male actors in their place with the lines they have and watch the dialog crumble. The books may be too dark and tense for some but the TV show is saccrin at its worse.
