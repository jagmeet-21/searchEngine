The New York Timesbestselling author of the Cold Fury series—Alex, Garrett, Zack,and Ryker—returns with the first novel in a hot new trilogy. Sela Halstead lost her innocence in a way that no sixteen-year-old should ever have to endure. She’s spent years trying to forget that night even while wondering about the identities of the monsters who brutalized her—until a telltale tattoo flashes across Sela’s TV screen. The incriminating ink belongs to Jonathon Townsend, the millionaire founder of The Sugar Bowl, a website that matches rich older men with impressionable young women. Obsessed with revenge, Sela infiltrates Townsend’s world, only to come face-to-face with a tantalizing complication: Beckett North, his charismatic business partner. The tech mastermind behind The Sugar Bowl, Beck always gets what he wants, in business and in bed. And yet, for a man who’s done every dirty thing imaginable, there’s something about the naïve, fresh-faced Sela that sparks his hottest fantasies. Because with her, it’s not just about sex. Beck opens up to her in ways he never has with other girls. So why does he get the feeling that she’s hiding something? In a world of pleasure and power, the shocking truth could turn them against each other—or bind them forever. Oh my Gosh!!! Now I know what everyone has been talking about. This book is fantastic and I’m so happy I got to read it, at last!!! The whole concept of the story and the idea of the firm is unique and refreshing. I was a bit confused by the prologue, like for a few seconds, but then I catched up pretty quickly on what was going on. What happened was so horrible and to happen that to a sixteen year old, just…horrible… So of course, what’s a girl gotta do once faced again with her tormentor and rapist? Make a plan, infiltrate his company and wait for the chance to kill him. Victims know that the only way you’re truly safe is when the person who did you wrong is dead. Once dead you can do no harm! The only problem, what if your plan has some unexpected turns? What if you pull in the deadly game of deceit and lies an innocent that has makes you feel whole again? And what if that said person turns out to be your target’s business partner and close friend? Well, those are the questions you will find answers to but only if you read this amazing book! All I can say is, I cannot wait for the next book in this series to come out, since I’m so gonig to read it! Definitely a book that I recommend!
